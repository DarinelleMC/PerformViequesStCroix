He was found dead in his Florida jail cell in November, 1979. Official reports stated he committed suicide. Many, including Wilfredo, did not believe he committed suicide. Conflicting reports from inmates in the same Tallahassee prison as Angel put into question his death. To this day, many believe he was murdered. The Vieques Fisherman Association honored Angel by erecting a statue in his memory in Vieques. The statue remains there today. "
