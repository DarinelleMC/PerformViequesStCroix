The second significant wave occured in 1927, when the shrinking economy of Vieques and its neighboring island municipality of P.R., Culebra, forced residents to look elsewhere for work. Puerto Ricans were granted U.S. citizenship in 1917, the same year the US Virgin Islands were purchased by the U.S. In 1927, Virgin Islanders were granted U.S. citizenship. With virtually no immigration restrictions between St. Croix and Vieques, people could move relatively freely. The U.S. Navy's arrival and the start of its widespread expropriation campaign in Vieques, led to another sizeable wave of Viequense migration to St. Croix in the 1940s. Finally, in the latter half of the 20th century, waves of Viequense migration to St. Croix continued as industrialization in the USVI brought the Hess Oil refinery, recruiting more Puerto Rican labor.

I use the term colonial subjects because it reflects the subjugation the U.S. government imposed via the U.S. Navy. In turn, these colonial histories manifest in performance.

In the convergence of calypso and carnival performances, we see not only a performance of solidarity between St. Croix and Vieques, but also one that connects the Puerto Rican archipelago to the broader Caribbean, disrupting borders formed along racial and linguistic lines. As artists from the main island of Puerto Rico, like Daddy Yankee, and other parts of the Caribbean and its diaspora, like Pitbull, draw inspiration from calypso artists in islands like Barbados, fusing them with reggaeton and other genres, a pan-Caribbean sound is created.
