Due to several waves of migration catalyzed by the sugar cane and oil industries, the expropriation and displacement of Viequenses by the U.S. Navy, and other socio-economic factors, Viequenses migrated in large numbers to St. Croix throughout the 20th century.

In Vieques, pitorro is called bilí and it is typically infused with quenepas, also called mamoncillo or guinep. These small, lime-like fruits are common throughout the Caribbean. As shown in the video, the rum is infused with quenepas and consumed in small shots. The availability of this drink in St. Croix demonstrates the influence of Viequense migration to the island, as well as the embodied traditions that shape cultural connections between the USVI and PR.

Their presence in St. Croix shows the presence of the Puerto Rican diaspora in the USVI. Moreover, the surprise expressed by the narrators of the video at seeing such foods in St. Croix points to the lack of awareness of diasporic Caribbean connections within the U.S. empire. The Puerto Rican diaspora is typically studied in the context of the continental U.S. But, as evident in this video, diasporas and intra-colonial connections exist beyond the imperial metropole. "
