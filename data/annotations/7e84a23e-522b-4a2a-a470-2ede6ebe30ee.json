Friendship Day celebration is called \"Fiesta en el Batey.\" A \"Batey\" refers to a sacred space or plaza where the indigenous Taínos of the Caribbean would meet or play ball games. The Taínos inhabited present-day Puerto Rico, the USVI, and several other Caribbean islands. \"Fiesta en el Batey\" thus translates to Part in the Batey. This detail articulates a past, pre-colonial connection between P.R. and the USVI."
