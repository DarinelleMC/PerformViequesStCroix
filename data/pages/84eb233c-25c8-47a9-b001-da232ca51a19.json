Consciously or not, the performances in this project, ranging from protest to music to collective celebrations, disrupt the coloniality and colonialism that oftentimes divides colonial subjects within the U.S. empire. Performance, as Diana Taylor teaches us, can be understood as acts of transmission. Performance, as deployed within this project, does not label embodiment as \"inauthentic\" or \"false.\" Rather, performance is used to describe the acts of transmission that convey knowledge, affect, and solidarity between Crucians and Viequenses; and Puerto Ricans and Virgin Islanders more broadly. Circumscribed within the historical and contemporary context of U.S. colonial rule, these performances show how people relate to each other in the periphery, both social and geographical, of empire. I do not aim to romanticize the struggles of Crucians and Viequenses. There are real material colonial conditions that subjugate these communities."

P.R. was ruled by the Spanish from 1493 until 1898, when, after the Spanish-American War, it became a possession of the U.S. A series of cases known as the Insular Cases in the early 20th century deemed P.R. an unincorporated territory. In 1917, Puerto Ricans were granted U.S. citizenship. Puerto Ricans can serve in the U.S. military and, upon receiving citizenship in 1917, were included in any military drafts enacted by the federal government. Until 1948, every governor of Puerto Rico was appointed by the president of the U.S. In 1948, P.R. elected its first governor and in 1952 it was granted commonwealth status. To this day it maintains this status which deprives it of many of the rights and liberties enjoyed by the 50 states of the U.S. As a commonwealth and unincorporated territory, Puerto Ricans cannot vote for president, do not have voting members in the U.S. congress, and are subject to U.S. laws. Disenfranchisement and a slew of other policies and apparatuses (e.g. an unelected and federally appointed fiscal oversight board that manages the archipelago's finances) demonstrate a colonial relationship between the U.S. and Puerto Rico.

After decades of negotiation and talks, the U.S. purchased the Danish West Indies for $25 million in 1917—the same year Puerto Ricans were granted citizenship. It would not be until 1927, however, that U.S. Virgin Islanders were granted citizenship. The U.S. Virgin Islands elected its first governor in 1970. Prior to 1970, the governor was appointed by the president of the U.S. Like P.R. and other U.S. territories, Virgin Islanders cannot vote for president, do not have voting members in the U.S. congress, and are subject to U.S. laws. As in P.R., Virgin Islanders can serve in the U.S. military and are subject to military drafts. This juridical-political framework demonstrates a colonial relationship between the U.S. and the U.S. Virgin Islands.

Like in Vieques and other parts of the Caribbean, the indigenous Taínos and Caribs inhabited St. Croix prior to and during European colonization. English is the predominant language in the U.S. Virgin Islands, including St. Croix. A large diaspora from the hispanic Caribbean (including Puerto Ricans) and francophone Caribbean resides in St. Croix, making Spanish and French Creole prominent languages on the island. "
