Consciously or not, the performances in this project, ranging from protest to music to collective celebrations, disrupt the coloniality and colonialism that oftentimes divides colonial subjects within the U.S. empire. Performance, as Diana Taylor teaches us, can be understood as acts of transmission. Performance, as deployed within this project, does not label embodiment as \"inauthentic\" or \"false.\" Rather, performance is used to describe the acts of transmission that convey knowledge, affect, and solidarity between Crucians and Viequenses; and Puerto Ricans and Virgin Islanders more broadly. Circumscribed within the historical and contemporary context of U.S. colonial rule, these performances show how people relate to each other in the periphery, both social and geographical, of empire. I do not aim to romanticize the struggles of Crucians and Viequenses. There are real material colonial conditions that subjugate these communities."

Puerto Rico was ruled by the Spanish from 1493 until 1898, when, after the Spanish-American War, Puerto Rico became a possession of the U.S. A series of cases known as the Insular Cases in the early 20th century deemed P.R. an unincorporated territory. In 1917, Puerto Ricans were granted U.S. citizenship. Puerto Ricans can serve in the U.S. military and, upon receiving citizenship in 1917, were included in any military drafts enacted by the federal government. Until 1948, every governor of Puerto Rico was appointed by the president of the U.S. In 1948, Puerto Rico elected its first governor and in 1952 it was granted commonwealth status. To this day it maintains this status which deprives it of many of the rights and liberties enjoyed by the 50 states of the U.S. As a U.S. Commonwealth and unincorporated territory, Puerto Ricans cannot vote for president, do not have voting members in the U.S. congress, and are subject to U.S. laws. Disenfranchisement and a slew of other policies and apparatuses (e.g. an unelected and federally appointed fiscal oversight board that manages the archipelago's finances) demonstrate a colonial relationship between the U.S. and Puerto Rico.
