Performance studies foregrounds embodied knowledge and approaches what constitutes performance in broad terms. Diana Taylor regards performance as acts of transmission that transfer memory, knowledge, and identity through citational behavior, or what Richard Schechner calls twice-behaved behavior. From everday acts to artistic productions to collective expressions, performance encompasses a wide range of embodied, citational behaviors. Performance studies also provides a methodological framework that allows us to interrogate events as performances within contextualized space, place, history, and systems of power. "

These acts range from collective expression to artistic creation to national government-sponsored celebrations. Through these acts, people embody solidarity, consciously or not, by articulating a trans-Caribbean union in peripheral U.S. territories. Whether it be through protest, music, or USVI-PR Friendship Day, each performance (to use Diana Taylor's framing) transmits memory, knowledge, and identity. "
