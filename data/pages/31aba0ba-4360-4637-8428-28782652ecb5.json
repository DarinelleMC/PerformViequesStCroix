Although the 1960s had witnessed a broad community anti-Navy movement, Viequense fishermen began interfering with Navy ships and coordinating a cross-coalition movement in 1978. My project focuses on one protest that took place on May 19, 1979 in Vieques to illustrate Crucian participation and intra-colonial solidarity."
