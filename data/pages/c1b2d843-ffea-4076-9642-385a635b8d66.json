Empire—past and present; British, French, Spanish, and American—connects the Caribbean. Although communities throughout the Caribbean have experienced empire in differing gradations, producing incommensurable struggles, this shared history also provides fertile ground for a more rigorous solidarity that understands liberation is intertwined.
