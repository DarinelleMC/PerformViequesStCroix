Crucian participation required flying from St. Croix to Vieques, then sailing into the Navy’s zone, and then building an encampment. The encampment and ecumenical prayer performed a reclaiming of Viequense land in a literal sense and, for those who prayed, a holy sanctioning of their anti-Navy struggle. Aware of the dangers, Crucians chose to defy the scripts U.S. law and discourses imposed. Later, when the Crucian Crusaders were arrested and prosecuted, they continued to embody solidarity for the anti-Navy Viequense movement.  "
