Twenty-one people were arrested and transported to the Roosevelt Roads Naval Base in the southeastern part of the main island of P.R."

The six Crucians, who would later be known as the Crucian Crusaders, had been part of a delegation of roughly two dozen Crucians that had traveled to Vieques to participate in the protest."
